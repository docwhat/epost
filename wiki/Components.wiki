#summary Components of epost

= Introduction = 

ePost is broken into several parts:
 * reflector
 * user web interface
 * admin cli interface
 * admin web interface

Each of these parts is a separate product and can be replaced with
something completely different.

In addition, there is the non-replacable database that store the
lists and the users.

= Reflector =

(sendmail, postfix, whatever), looks at the headers to calculate the
mailing lists it is destined for, and then sends it to the correct
users.

= User Web Interface =

This is simply a nice web interface to the database to allow easy
subscription and unsubscription.

= Admin CIL interface =

This is a CLI interface for managing the mailing lists and users.

= Admin Web interface = 

A pretty web interface for managing the mailing lists and users.
